### Deprecation & removal notices

1. This version (`1.31.0`) no longer supports a Postgres-only deployment of PostHog. Read [our migration guide](/docs/self-host/migrate-from-postgres-to-clickhouse) for instructions on moving over to a ClickHouse version. ClickHouse provides faster queries and is optimized for very large volumes of data, and you will also get a new lot of features.
2. We're deprecating the **Sessions** insight (distribution of session length). Please [reach out](/support) if you have any feedback on this.
