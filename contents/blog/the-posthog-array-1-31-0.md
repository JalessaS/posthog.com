## PostHog 1.31.0 release notes

> Don't see the new features on your self-hosted deployment? Remember to [update your PostHog instance](/docs/self-host/configure/upgrading-posthog).

**Release highlights:**
- [Group Analytics](#group-analytics)
- [Improved Correlation Analysis](#improved-correlation-analysis)
- [Improved user experience](#improved-user-experience)

### Group Analytics

Introducing Group Analytics! Group Analytics enable you to perform aggregation on multiple levels aside from Users. For instance, if you have a B2B product, you will now be able not only to identify unique individual users, but users belonging to a Company. This enables analytics such as retention by company, events performed by unique companies, among many others. 

You can have multiple groups and they can change dynamically. Check out [the docs](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) for more details.

> üéÅ Group Analytics is a premium feature and requires a PostHog Scale or Enterprise license. [Learn more](/pricing).

### Improved Correlation Analysis

Correlation Analysis just got better! Aside from significantly improving the UI & UX, we've introduced a details option for advanced users looking for deeper understanding of how events and/or properties contribute to conversion or drop-offs. This new detail view will show a complete confusion matrix (which shows true positives, true negatives, false negatives and false postivies) plus a correlation score (from `-1.0` to `1.0` which signals how strongly performing an event or having a property correlates with conversion or drop-offs).

### Improved user experience

We've been working hard on creating the best user experience, particularly in our core Analytics product. Creating and navigating insights will now be a lot faster and smoother. Improvements include: finding events & properties faster, overall faster navigation, improvements to tooltips, etc.

### Other improvements & fixes
- Improved breakdown in funnels. We have a new vertical layout to display funnels broken down by a property (e.g. conversion by browser) that will make it even easier to compare conversion across multiple dimensions.
- Searching events & properties is now significantly faster. We've changed the way these properties are shown and we now list them by popularity within your team. Create those insights faster!
- Following our [lemonade redesign](/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0#fresh-new-look-and-feel) we now have a ton more UI improvements. In particular tables got a pretty slick facelift.
- We've improved the layout configuration for dashboards so they'll be more responsive and look better on very small or very large screens.
- Pushed significant improvements to the recordings list load time.
- Introducing a new funnel query builder. We now group advanced options separately, so you funnel definition is clearer.
- Fixed bug in feature flags when in certain cases a 0% release was considered as a 100% release.
- Fixed bug where private project names were shown to members who shouldn't have access.
- Plus 350+ improvements & fixes.

### Deprecation & removal notices

1. This version (`1.31.0`) no longer supports a Postgres-only deployment of PostHog. Read [our migration guide](/docs/self-host/migrate-from-postgres-to-clickhouse) for instructions on moving over to a ClickHouse version. ClickHouse provides faster queries and is optimized for very large volumes of data, and you will also get a new lot of features.
2. We're deprecating the **Sessions** insight (distribution of session length). Please [reach out](/support) if you have any feedback on this.
