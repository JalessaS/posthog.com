## PostHog 1.31.0 release notes

> Don't see the new features on your self-hosted deployment? Remember to [update your PostHog instance](/docs/self-host/configure/upgrading-posthog).

**Release highlights:**
- [Group Analytics](#group-analytics)
- [Improved Correlation Analysis](#improved-correlation-analysis)
- [Improved user experience](#improved-user-experience)

### Group Analytics

Introducing Group Analytics! Group Analytics enable you to analyze groups, which aggregate events within PostHog. You can have multiple groups and they can even change dynamically. 

Group Analytics is especially useful if you have a B2B product, as you will now be able to create a Company group type which tracks all unique users within a company, then create insights such as retention by company and events performed by unique companies. 

Visit our [Group Analytics documentation](/docs/user-guides/group-analytics) to find out what else is possible with Group Analytics.

> üéÅ Group Analytics is a premium feature and requires a PostHog Scale or Enterprise license. [Learn more](/pricing).

### Improved Correlation Analysis

Correlation Analysis just got better! Aside from significantly improving the UI & UX, we've introduced a details option for advanced users looking for deeper understanding of how events and properties contribute to conversion or drop-offs. This new detail view will show a complete confusion matrix which shows true positives, true negatives, false negatives and false postives. We've also added a correlation score from `-1.0` to `1.0` to signal how strongly an event or property correlates with conversion or drop-off.

### Improved user experience

We've been working hard on creating the best user experience, particularly in our core Analytics product. Creating and navigating insights will now be a lot faster and smoother. Improvements include: finding events & properties faster, overall faster navigation, improvements to tooltips, etc.

### Other improvements & fixes
- Improved breakdown in funnels. We have a new vertical layout to display funnels broken down by a property (e.g. conversion by browser) that will make it even easier to compare conversion across multiple dimensions.
- Searching events & properties is now significantly faster. We've changed the way these properties are shown and we now list them by popularity within your team. Create those insights faster!
- Following our [lemonade redesign](/blog/the-posthog-array-1-30-0#fresh-new-look-and-feel) we now have a ton more UI improvements. In particular tables got a pretty slick facelift.
- We've improved the layout configuration for dashboards so they'll be more responsive and look better on very small or very large screens.
- Pushed significant improvements to the recordings list load time.
- Introducing a new funnel query builder! We now group advanced options separately, so funnel definition is clearer.
- Fixed a bug in Feature Flags where a 0% release was sometimes considered as a 100% release.
- Fixed a bug where private project names were shown to members who shouldn't have access.
- Plus 350+ improvements & fixes.

### Deprecation & removal notices

1. This version (`1.31.0`) no longer supports a Postgres-only deployment of PostHog. Read [our migration guide](/docs/self-host/migrate-from-postgres-to-clickhouse) for instructions on moving over to a ClickHouse version. ClickHouse provides faster queries and is optimized for very large volumes of data, and you will also get a new lot of features.
2. We're [deprecating the **Sessions** insight](/blog/sessions-removal) (distribution of session length). Please [reach out](/support) if you have any feedback on this.
